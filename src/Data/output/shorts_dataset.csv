jkKOCL7rA1Q,19.69,26.44," They said in the entire kingdom, we should have compassion for all living beings, including animals."
jkKOCL7rA1Q,26.46,31.467,So there are no commercial slaughterhouses in Bhutan.
jkKOCL7rA1Q,31.688,33.951,This doesn't mean everyone is vegetarian.

jkKOCL7rA1Q,38.237,39.119,I eat meat.
jkKOCL7rA1Q,39.139,40.821,"Yes, they eat meat."

jNsnwcpMIXQ,0.031,2.174, Here are three items I bought for my next international trip.
jNsnwcpMIXQ,2.255,3.416,"First, this hero clip."
jNsnwcpMIXQ,3.436,7.803,I was so sick of not having a place to hang my backpack in some very questionable bathroom situations.
jNsnwcpMIXQ,7.904,10.247,"And as a solo traveler, you can't always just leave it with someone."
jNsnwcpMIXQ,10.347,13.773,"It's got a lot of movement, so you can position it how you need it, and it can hang on a lot of things."
jNsnwcpMIXQ,13.853,16.097,So now my bags will not be resting on gross floors.
jNsnwcpMIXQ,16.377,17.258,"Next, a laundry bar."
jNsnwcpMIXQ,17.479,19.542,I re-wear the same outfits over and over and over.
jNsnwcpMIXQ,19.522,24.829, And on my last trip I had some issues with laundry services either ruining my clothes or quite literally not cleaning them at all.
jNsnwcpMIXQ,24.929,27.813,Like this is what happened when I washed my shirt after I got it back from laundry.
jNsnwcpMIXQ,27.973,32.96,So I will be bringing this laundry bar along with my scrubba bag and will resume doing laundry myself for certain items.
jNsnwcpMIXQ,33.28,35.704,"And lastly, low top hiking shoes aka trail runners."
jNsnwcpMIXQ,35.924,41.952,"On my previous trips I always brought my high top ultra hikers because A, I absolutely love these shoes and B, they're the only hiking shoes I had."
jNsnwcpMIXQ,41.932,46.371," But after I wore them to the ground and it was time for a new pair, I decided to try out the low top version this time."
jNsnwcpMIXQ,46.491,52.195,I can get a little more wear out of them since they don't look like full on hiking boots and I've already put over 50 miles on them and absolutely love them.
t8xqAd1Kq40,0.082,2.665, Three things we learned about Scandinavian hotels that are kind of weird.
t8xqAd1Kq40,2.685,3.345,No conditioner.
t8xqAd1Kq40,3.385,4.366,We have shampoo.
t8xqAd1Kq40,4.787,5.748,We have shower gel.
t8xqAd1Kq40,5.888,8.33,My hair has been so staticky.
t8xqAd1Kq40,8.35,10.192,Number two is washcloths.
t8xqAd1Kq40,10.232,12.775,We haven't had a single washcloth in any of our hotels.
t8xqAd1Kq40,12.795,15.778,"I just keep wondering, how do people wash their bodies in the shower?"
t8xqAd1Kq40,15.798,16.919,Do they use their hand?
t8xqAd1Kq40,17.039,19.121,Or maybe these gigantic hand towels?
t8xqAd1Kq40,19.141,20.983,We may or may not have done that a time or two.
t8xqAd1Kq40,21.103,22.565,"Last but not least, separate duvets."
t8xqAd1Kq40,22.585,27.49,"When we first got here, we thought this was kind of weird, but it's really grown on us because you can still"
t8xqAd1Kq40,27.47,31.106," sleep next to each other, but if one person gets hot, you can't have your own space."
t8xqAd1Kq40,31.126,36.489,"Where we come from, there's always one sheet, one blanket, but here, there's no sheet, and you get your own blanket."
t8xqAd1Kq40,36.509,37.152,That's kinda nice.
t8xqAd1Kq40,37.212,38.036,What would you prefer?
HguX69Hwbfc,0.031,12.493," Now, if you're coming to Ireland, the breakfast you need to have is a full Irish breakfast, you know, with the hash brown, the fried eggs, the sausage, which is fantastic, the bacon, the tomatoes, and mushrooms, and beans, and toasted tea."
HguX69Hwbfc,12.995,13.577,It's amazing.
HguX69Hwbfc,13.597,14.801,You want to have that when you're here.
9QoVxaavHPA,0.031,3.737," Everyone dreams of coming to Australia saying, oh, it's going to be so sunny."
9QoVxaavHPA,4.157,5.78,No one talks about the winters.
9QoVxaavHPA,6.04,8.584,It's truly one of the worst winters you'll experience.
9QoVxaavHPA,8.664,13.432,The inside of your home is colder than the outside of your home because insulation just doesn't exist.
9QoVxaavHPA,13.612,16.977,"Yeah, have fun winding down at home in your thermals and your puffer jacket."
9QoVxaavHPA,16.957,19.685," So when it rains here, it really pisses down."
9QoVxaavHPA,19.845,22.012,So public transport just malfunctions for fun.
9QoVxaavHPA,22.112,29.192,"And when you're walking around in the rain, you better not be walking between two buildings because that is a wind tunnel, aka a deathtrap for your umbrella."
9QoVxaavHPA,29.453,32.943,I have lived in London during the winter and it was better than this.
csCrPgrvKJI,0.031,2.957, Things in countryside Japan that could send you into a coma.
csCrPgrvKJI,2.977,5.381,"The animals, because it's not all cute bowing deer."
csCrPgrvKJI,5.662,10.311,"Like, did I tell you guys, literally the first day I started working, this thing jumped out of my co-worker's bag."
csCrPgrvKJI,10.331,15.801,"Between the giant spiders, the venomous centipedes, and the murder hornets, it was hard to go outside sometimes."
csCrPgrvKJI,15.821,18.226,"And if it's not the bugs that get you, the ghosts will."
csCrPgrvKJI,18.486,22.073,You do not truly understand Japanese horror stories until you're here.
csCrPgrvKJI,22.053,27.261, It's pretty common out here to be biking along down the streets when you come across a thousand year old shrine.
csCrPgrvKJI,27.381,30.827,"And not only that, but there's also a ton of abandoned towns out in the countryside."
csCrPgrvKJI,30.907,33.872,So everything just feels kind of old and haunted.
csCrPgrvKJI,34.032,36.396,"And one thing nobody's surviving, the K trucks."
csCrPgrvKJI,36.636,40.402,"I kind of want one of these actually, but they're absolute menaces on the road."

v2ockv40MZg,2.016,2.618,Let me explain.
v2ockv40MZg,3.621,5.446,"To do it the easiest way, pull out the waist."
v2ockv40MZg,5.566,7.291,"And then stick your hand in, brother."

FFgAR4Q8d9M,11.769,17.839,"And you might also think that your salad has enough fiber, but just one tablespoon of flaxseeds have around three times more."
FFgAR4Q8d9M,18.059,21.364,"And you definitely think that a cup of quinoa has enough fiber,"
FFgAR4Q8d9M,21.344,24.48, but this same cup of kidney beans has around 4 times more.
FFgAR4Q8d9M,24.741,31.414,All of these foods are healthy and nutritious for you but some foods that feel high in fiber have much lesser fiber than other foods.
49PbU5l5RCE,0.031,4.236," The number one question everyone asks me as a food influencer is, how do I maintain my weight?"

49PbU5l5RCE,6.359,9.422,"Mondays, I mostly play badminton for an hour to start off light."
49PbU5l5RCE,9.442,10.744,"On Tuesday, I had a shoot."
49PbU5l5RCE,10.824,14.929,"So after that, I hit up a lower body workout class, which was super intense."
49PbU5l5RCE,14.949,21.537,"The next day, I had back-to-back shoots, which got me so tired that I booked a light yoga class, followed by meditation to ground myself."
49PbU5l5RCE,21.557,25.862,"My badminton shoes finally arrived, so I booked a midnight baddie class to test them out."

F9KWiQqhW2k,3.415,6.72,Now it feels like you need a warm-up just to make it to the bathroom.

F9KWiQqhW2k,13.969,19.056,"Modern life has tricked you into sitting too much, moving too little and forgetting how much motion matters."

F9KWiQqhW2k,23.762,27.827,"But all they get is a couch, a screen and processed food."
F9KWiQqhW2k,27.807,34.458, Chances are you've already tried hitting the gym or starting a workout routine only to lose interest or motivation after a while.
F9KWiQqhW2k,35.299,36.18,But here's the good news.

58BlOtVG_IE,0.031,8.186," I would watch YouTube videos, and then I found a channel, his name was Rob Dom, and he made a video about what he did for a living to afford a Lamborghini Diablo."
58BlOtVG_IE,8.266,10.49,And I found that video so inspirational.
58BlOtVG_IE,10.69,15.258,"Late 2016, I made my first video about just how I got started in real estate, and I kept posting."
58BlOtVG_IE,15.338,18.664,"And I realized if I post once a week, the videos do X amount of views."
58BlOtVG_IE,18.885,23.052,"If I post twice a week, I'm all of a sudden now gaining subscribers and getting more views."
58BlOtVG_IE,23.032,26.259, A lot of people in real estate were telling me I'm wasting my time on YouTube.
58BlOtVG_IE,26.28,26.56,Of course.
58BlOtVG_IE,26.58,28.344,"Because it's like, okay, sure, you're making $100 a day."
58BlOtVG_IE,28.605,31.131,But imagine if you applied that time to real estate.
58BlOtVG_IE,31.391,36.503,"And it got to a point where it started impacting my real estate work, because in real estate, I was just thinking YouTube."
58BlOtVG_IE,36.523,36.644,Sure.
58BlOtVG_IE,36.664,37.686,That's all I wanted to do.

DmMmnSIQmx8,2.578,5.306,Germany got rich by using cheap oil to power their industries.
DmMmnSIQmx8,5.566,8.214,"But with fossil fuel prices rising, they are in deep trouble."

DmMmnSIQmx8,12.927,15.053,Germany is a tired man.
DmMmnSIQmx8,15.033,18.462, the trend seems to be advanced manufacturing moving away from Germany.
DmMmnSIQmx8,18.662,26.021,"The massive advantage of being German-made is that they can charge more for advanced machinery, so paying workers more doesn't necessarily impact the price."
DmMmnSIQmx8,26.341,31.033,That and the stereotype of German engineering have been keeping their manufacturing sector afloat.
DmMmnSIQmx8,31.013,37.206, But now China has started building their own manufacturing centers and are making a lot of high-end goods for a cheaper price.
DmMmnSIQmx8,37.526,49.291,"Yes, they still make a lot of crap, but China is already by far the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles, producing more than half of all the EVs made in the world, and three times as many as Germany."

S2AZbZ_K8vY,0.031,3.135, These are five AI tools that I use pretty much every day.
S2AZbZ_K8vY,3.256,5.038,"Firstly, we have Claude by Anthropic."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,5.239,8.643,"I use Claude for most things rather than ChatGPT these days, because it's just way better."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,8.724,11.848,And it's also got really nice language features where you can directly talk to the app.
S2AZbZ_K8vY,11.868,14.392,"Next up is VoicePal, which is an app that my team and I actually built."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,14.532,16.234,And I use VoicePal every day for writing.
S2AZbZ_K8vY,16.315,19.74,"So instead of typing stuff out on the computer, instead I speak it into VoicePal."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,19.9,22.303,VoicePal asks me sensible follow-up questions based on what I've said.
S2AZbZ_K8vY,22.383,25.508,"And then with a single click, I can export it as a first draft of my writing."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,25.548,29.734,"And because of this, I get way more writing done, it's way more fun, and I can walk around while doing my writing."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,29.714,33.298," Thirdly, there is an app called Grain, which I use to record all of my Zoom calls."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,33.458,46.192,"This is super helpful because it transcribes all the Zoom calls, it figures out action points, figures out takeaways, and if I'm speaking to a friend or a coach or a team member and we come up with some cool ideas, we can take the transcript of that call from Grain, we can put it into Claude, and we can use that to generate ideas for writing."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,46.213,50.818,"Fourth on the list is Gamma AI, and that is a cool app that helps you generate slides using AI."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,50.918,52.92,This is good for like proposals and pitch decks and stuff.
S2AZbZ_K8vY,52.9,57.171," And then finally, the AI augmented app that I used to listen to my podcasts is called Snipped."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,57.452,61.042,And Snipped is really cool because it generates transcripts for every single podcast that you might listen to.
S2AZbZ_K8vY,61.242,69.344,"And if you hear something that you find interesting, you can create a Snip and then the AI will figure out what was the thing that was just being said, and we'll turn that into like a takeaway or a highlight that you can then save."
S2AZbZ_K8vY,69.424,72.652,And this makes it way easier to remember the stuff that you listen to in podcasts.

-o3-pVBOtis,26.994,30.324,"They're like, shut up, shut up, heckler, shut up."
-o3-pVBOtis,30.886,31.648,You'll never see that.
-o3-pVBOtis,32.069,33.273,"There was like, what did he say?"
-o3-pVBOtis,33.313,35.76,And then play along with it.

X8LglXSG53A,4.883,11.338,"It's not magic, it's an algorithm built into nature, and we can easily reproduce it in computers by programming three simple rules."
X8LglXSG53A,11.579,16.15,"Imagine we work for the government's top secret bird program, but currently the birds fly around randomly."
X8LglXSG53A,16.13,21.021, So our algorithm needs a rule for separation that tells the bird not to run into its flock mates.
X8LglXSG53A,21.181,26.733,"Still too random, so now let's write a rule for alignment that tells each bird to steer towards the average heading of the flock."
X8LglXSG53A,26.753,36.574,"Now they move together in a straight line, but if we add one more rule for cohesion that tells them to steer towards the average center of mass, we get these cool patterns that simulate flocking behavior in nature."

m3WI-9vEZlw,20.067,21.229,A quantum computer?
m3WI-9vEZlw,21.698,26.357," like this one, replaces the binary logic with the laws of quantum physics."

pNt4p7TExmY,12.36,14.583,"And it used to be, like, very easy."
pNt4p7TExmY,14.783,21.009,"You kind of, like, make a little robotic hand that does a Rubik's Cube or a Dota bot, and it's like, oh, it does some things, but definitely not an AGI."
pNt4p7TExmY,21.629,27.355,"It's obviously harder to say now, and so we're trying to, like, stop,"
pNt4p7TExmY,27.892,34.164," talking about AGI as this general thing, and we have this levels framework, because the word AGI has become so overloaded."
pNt4p7TExmY,35.426,43.241,"So, like, real quickly, we use one for chatbots, two for reasoners, three for agents, four for innovators, and five for organizations, like, roughly."

PbIkYHbzFBY,0.031,7.84," from the highest level of the post-labor economics kind of vision that you've been sharing, like, what should we be thinking about right now?"
PbIkYHbzFBY,8.081,10.504,"Kind of the mantra that I've come up with is better, faster, cheaper, safer."
PbIkYHbzFBY,10.584,18.293,"And so, historically, whenever a technology or new way of doing things surpasses the old way of doing things on those four metrics, it usually becomes inevitable."
PbIkYHbzFBY,18.453,22.478,"We're having fully automated, you know, AI-powered farm equipment now."
PbIkYHbzFBY,22.458,26.424," In each of those cases, there's usually, there's a few ways of looking at it."
PbIkYHbzFBY,26.444,28.187,"So time, you know, it's something you can measure with a watch."
PbIkYHbzFBY,28.647,29.649,There's energy input.
PbIkYHbzFBY,29.949,33.094,"If something is more energetically efficient, human labor is a huge component."
PbIkYHbzFBY,33.114,34.516,So that's all going away as well.
PbIkYHbzFBY,35.017,36.88,So that's the kind of part one is.
PbIkYHbzFBY,36.96,38.062,"Better, faster, cheaper, safer."
PbIkYHbzFBY,38.603,39.885,Machines replace humans.
PbIkYHbzFBY,39.905,42.248,We've seen this time and again over the last few centuries.
PbIkYHbzFBY,42.729,46.795,"So the next component is, okay, well, if you take that out to its maximum conclusion,"
PbIkYHbzFBY,47.129,51.057," then you end up in a situation where who has jobs anymore, right?"
PbIkYHbzFBY,51.197,58.913,"Or even if there are some jobs left, if a good chunk of today's jobs go away, then what do you do if you have 20, 30, 40% unemployment rate?"
PbIkYHbzFBY,58.933,61.138,That requires an entirely new economic paradigm.
PbIkYHbzFBY,61.591,67.708," Uh, and so that's what we call the economic agency paradox, which is basically technology makes goods and services cheaper."
PbIkYHbzFBY,68.29,72.06,"Uh, but at the same time, it takes the wages that you'd use to pay for those new goods and services."
PbIkYHbzFBY,72.101,75.771,So then nobody has any money in order to pay for those things that because they lost jobs.

mkcgVN90zl0,12.068,19.238,"And then an NFC chip on the inside that when I tap it against my phone, works with the Brick app to lock down your phone's functionalities."
mkcgVN90zl0,19.218,21.764, So let's say that I am addicted to scrolling Instagram.
mkcgVN90zl0,21.784,25.673,"So right now I am unbricked, which means that if I want to open up Instagram, I can do it fine."

C-HclSxMSCg,18.34,21.883, And I think now is a more important time than ever.
C-HclSxMSCg,22.304,24.425,The world needs more education.
C-HclSxMSCg,24.486,29.75,You could look at national or even international data on things like college readiness.

C-HclSxMSCg,40.52,43.923,And we need to make sure that people are as prepared as possible.
C-HclSxMSCg,44.103,48.347,Education has never been more important than it is today.

WKvAsz3RoRE,16.555,22.203,The phone will never flip simply end over end without also rotating in one of the other directions.
WKvAsz3RoRE,22.743,23.845,So why does this happen?
Uji6RF2wx18,0.031,2.775," This is a Galton board, and it's very satisfying."
Uji6RF2wx18,2.956,8.244,"Basically, the balls come down through these pegs, and then they always end up making this normal distribution curve, no matter what."
Uji6RF2wx18,8.604,9.385,So why does that happen?
Uji6RF2wx18,9.746,17.919,"Well, basically, every time a ball hits a peg, it has a 50-50 shot of going left or right, which makes it difficult to predict where any one ball will end up."
Uji6RF2wx18,18.079,21.364,"But when you have enough of them, you can start to see these patterns emerge."
Uji6RF2wx18,21.344,27.434, because the probability of it landing in the center is much higher because there's a lot more paths that lead there versus the outside.
Uji6RF2wx18,27.474,35.306,And it's a good example of why we need to have large enough sample sizes or data sets to make good predictions in science or math.
Uji6RF2wx18,35.666,40.534,"But more importantly, I think it's a far superior version of a rain stick."
uDaFgNcTVSE,0.537,2.521," Ah, summer."
uDaFgNcTVSE,2.541,4.364,A time for fun in the sun.
uDaFgNcTVSE,5.146,9.134,"With so many options available, how do you choose the right sunscreen?"
uDaFgNcTVSE,10.055,11.699,There are three things to keep in mind.
uDaFgNcTVSE,12.099,14.624,"SPF, ingredients, and application."
uDaFgNcTVSE,15.506,16.588,Let's start with SPF.
uDaFgNcTVSE,17.21,22.917," Make sure to opt for at least 15, which blocks 93% of UVB rays."
uDaFgNcTVSE,23.678,28.363,"SPF 30 blocks 97%, and 50 blocks 98%."
uDaFgNcTVSE,29.084,31.107,"Next, ingredients."
uDaFgNcTVSE,31.687,38.335,"If you're concerned about irritants, look for mineral-based formulas with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide."
uDaFgNcTVSE,38.656,41.479,And don't worry if they go on a little bit thick.
uDaFgNcTVSE,41.459,43.362," Lastly, application."
uDaFgNcTVSE,44.004,50.195,"Sprays can be convenient to put on, but make sure you're applying a thick enough layer for full protection."
uDaFgNcTVSE,50.595,51.437,Most people don't.
uDaFgNcTVSE,52.419,56.987,"Whichever you choose, remember to lather up and keep your skin healthy."
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,0.031,6.541," Scientists just reverse-engineered the formula for Roman concrete, and it's way better than the modern stuff."
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,6.581,13.972,"While today's concrete can degrade in as little as 50 years, plenty of Roman structures that were built thousands of years ago are still going strong."
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,14.052,19.861,"A few years ago, we learned that mixing concrete with seawater instead of freshwater was part of the Roman secret."
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,19.881,23.967,But a 2023 study found that wasn't the only trick up their sleeves.
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,24.067,26.511,"They had sleeves, which they didn't because they had togas."
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,26.491,29.315, One concrete recipe calls for a mineral called quicklime.
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,29.335,36.725,"When mixed with seawater, quicklime produces a hot chemical reaction and leaves chunks of undissolved lime throughout the mixture."
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,36.765,39.81,This produces concrete that can repair itself.
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,39.91,47.2,"When it cracks, rainwater leaks in and hits those lime chunks, which reactivates the cement and fills the gaps as they form."
Wc7Q2UJ3WtE,47.18,51.421," In 2021, cement production accounted for 8% of greenhouse gas emissions."

tQPCfZKWfCU,0.031,3.517, Did you know that live streams can get you monetized on YouTube?
tQPCfZKWfCU,3.738,8.827,"Live streams are great for getting that 4,000 hours of watch time you need to get into the YouTube Partner Program."
tQPCfZKWfCU,8.847,15.88,"That's because the watch time you get from live streams actually counts towards your watch time hours needed for the YouTube Partner Program, unlike YouTube Shorts."
tQPCfZKWfCU,16.101,20.188,"No, instead for Shorts, you need 10 million views in the span of 90 days."
LQiGCi32zd8,0.031,2.536, This is what happens when streamers forget to turn the camera off.
LQiGCi32zd8,2.556,12.775,First we have DrDisRespect who accidentally leaked his face after he forgot the camera was still on.
LQiGCi32zd8,12.795,19.187,Next one might give you a heart attack because chess streamer Alexandra Botez accidentally went live while making a thumbnail faces.
SntyepuQlro,0.031,2.534," I did my first stream in real life, or that's what my chat thought."
SntyepuQlro,2.554,10.322,"What actually happened is two hours before my stream, I pre-recorded a setup tour so that when I go live, I'll play the video and everyone will hopefully think that I'm actually live."
SntyepuQlro,10.362,13.866,"In my usual streams, I always click a couple of buttons and set up my stream before I go live."
SntyepuQlro,13.886,15.147,So that's what I did in my pre-recording.
SntyepuQlro,16.108,19.151,And then I thought of reading a fake message so that people actually thought that I was reading chat.
SntyepuQlro,19.171,20.132,You want me to read a message to prove it?
SntyepuQlro,20.273,21.694,"Hi, yo, what's up, Jmaster22."
SntyepuQlro,21.894,24.557,"And after I read that message, everyone believed that I was streaming."
SntyepuQlro,24.577,25.779,So I started giving a tour of my setup.
SntyepuQlro,25.799,27.54,This is my light that turns the background blue.
SntyepuQlro,27.621,29.042,"So if I flick this on right here,"
SntyepuQlro,30.271,32.581, You'll be able to see the whole background turns blue.
SntyepuQlro,32.641,36.035,"And while the tour was going, chat was freaking out that I was doing a real-life stream."
SntyepuQlro,36.075,38.184,But what I was actually doing is just sitting at my computer.
SntyepuQlro,38.345,39.791,No one knows that it's fake.
SntyepuQlro,39.851,41.558,How does no one know this is fake?

RiOqgmmcSvc,5.917,7.443,"Why, are you baking something?"
RiOqgmmcSvc,7.464,10.899,"No, I want to plant it outside and see if it turns into a real flower."

Cp68Ob4vPs0,0.031,4.716," Hey, I'm working on a new video, but in the meantime, here's a little trick that'll make you look like a genius."
Cp68Ob4vPs0,4.796,5.416,Check this out.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,5.616,9.4,Ask someone for a random number between 22 and 99.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,10.041,15.426,"And you can make a magic square where every row, column, and diagonal adds up to the number they gave you."
Cp68Ob4vPs0,15.847,17.008,Say they give you the number 51.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,18.189,21.592,Subtract 20 from the number they gave you to give you A.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,22.133,23.834,Add 1 to A to get B.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,24.155,28.519,"Add 1 to B to get C. And then for D, subtract 1 from A."
Cp68Ob4vPs0,28.499,29.341, That's the hard part.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,29.381,31.767,Now just fill in a pattern of pairs that add up to 9.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,31.787,32.91,5 and 4.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,32.93,33.492,1 and 8.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,33.532,34.895,3 and 6.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,34.916,36.219,7 and 2.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,36.56,38.605,Throw another 9 in the bottom right.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,38.785,41.773,"And the remaining boxes are 10, 11, and 12."
Cp68Ob4vPs0,42.094,42.515,That's it.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,42.696,44.721,"Every way you add up a line, you'll get 51."
Cp68Ob4vPs0,44.961,48.29,And this works for every number between 22 and 99.
Cp68Ob4vPs0,48.611,49.413,Try this on someone.
